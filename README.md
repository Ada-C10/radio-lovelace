# Radio Lovelace

## Learning Goals

This project is designed to exercise the following skills:

- Reading and understanding a substantial amount of existing React code
- Lifting React state from a child component to a parent component
- Event hanlding in React across several levels of nested components

## Introduction

A local radio station, Radio Lovelace, has asked your company to build an app to manage playlists. 

### What's Already Here?

- Functional stateless components
- CSS / BEM

## Requirements

### Wave 0: Reading

### Wave 1: Marking Favorites

### Wave 2: Send to Top

### Wave 3: Switch Lists

### Optional Enhancements

Don't even read this list until you've completed the core requirements and submitted a pull request.

- Instead of splitting the list of tracks down the middle, write some code that splits the list in two so that the play times are as close as possible. What is the time complexity of your code? What is `n`?
- Replace the "send to top" button with two buttons, "up" and "down", that move a track up or down one position in its playlist
- Allow the user to add another playlist, and to move tracks right and left between playlists
- Add a [managed form](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) to allow the user to add their own track (we will formally cover managed forms next week)
