## Introduction

## Requirements

### Wave 0: Reading

### Wave 1: Marking Favorites

### Wave 2: Send to Top

### Wave 3: Switch Lists

### Optional Enhancements

Don't even read this list until you've completed the core requirements and submitted a pull request.

- Replace the "send to top" button with two buttons, "up" and "down", that move a track up or down one position in its playlist
- Allow the user to add another playlist, and to move tracks right and left between playlists
- Add a [managed form](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) to allow the user to add their own track (we will formally cover managed forms next week)
